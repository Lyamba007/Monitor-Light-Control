# Monitor-Light-Control
A prototype of a software and hardware control system for external LED backlight of a PC monitor using a hardware platform based on a microcontroller device and a client-server part, based on a mobile application on the Android platform.
The control device is based on the microcontroller ESP-12E (ESP8266) with Wi-Fi module NodeMCU. The microcontroller is programmed in the ะก programming language in the Arduino IDE using the standard description of the software implementation in this IDE.
The mobile part of the system is implemented on the Android platform in the C # programming language using Xamarin and XAML technology, as a GUI layout.
The layout of the outdoor lighting control system is implemented on the basis of a simplified circuit implementation using LED strip based on WS2812B LEDs.
